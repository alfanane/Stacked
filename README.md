**Stacked** is a robust Kotlin library for Minecraft (Paper/Spigot) developers, designed to provide a unified
abstraction layer for item management. It simplifies handling, serializing, and modifying items across various popular
custom item plugins.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Unified Item API: Interface with multiple item providers through a single, consistent API.
- Cross-Plugin Support: Native support for Oraxen, Nexo, ItemsAdder, MythicMobs, MMOItems, HeadDatabase, Eco, and
  CraftEngine.
- Rich Item Options: Granular control over item properties including Lore, Enchants, Custom Model Data, Dye colors, and
  Spawner types via ItemOptionHandle.
- Serialization Layer: Seamlessly serialize and deserialize items for database storage or configuration files.
- Interaction Handling: Built-in event system to handle complex item interactions (clicks, drops, swaps) easily.

## 📦 Installation

Add the repository and dependency to your build.gradle.kts:

````kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "aquatic-releases"
        url = uri("https://repo.nekroplex.com/releases")
    }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("gg.aquatic.stacked:Stacked:26.0.1")
}
````

## 💡 Quick Start

1. Initialization
   You must initialize the library with your plugin instance and a CoroutineScope:

    ````kotlin
    initializeStacked(myPlugin, myCoroutineScope)
    Stacked.injectFactories()
    ````

2. Registering an Item with Logic
   You can register items with unique IDs and attach interaction handlers directly:

    ````kotlin
    val stackedItem = ... // Create or load your StackedItem
    stackedItem.register("my_namespace", "my_item_id") { event ->
        event.player.sendMessage("You clicked a custom item!")
    }
    ````

3. Retrieving a StackedItem
   Retrieve items from the registry at any time:

    ````kotlin
    val item = StackedItem.ITEMS["my_namespace:my_item_id"]
    val itemStack = item?.getItem()
    ````

## 🛠️ Supported Factories
